# Restaurant Reservation System

## Purpose
Work with various Java and Spring style technologies to build a robust and scalable event-driven application.

## Project Story
Solve the ad-hoc restaurant reservation problem by creating a system that efficiently handles reservations and provides real-time feedback to users.

## Program Overview
This project is an event-driven reservation system where users can make reservations that are processed through a message broker. The system then sends confirmation messages to a different Kafka topic, ensuring that reservations are managed asynchronously and confirmations are delivered reliably.
