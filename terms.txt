Inversion of Control - Framework itself handles the maintain once of objects and dependencies. Less passing of objects in function definitions.  

Dependecy Injection - Create an object and then inject dependencies into it directly (Autowiring) 

Profiling - Measuring Runtime, memory, bottlenecks, etc 

Binder - Abstract and underlying tech to handle communication 

Binding - Specific mapping for input / output for messaging channels 

Serialization - We want to send messages / data as bytes, not strings / objects for efficiencyâ€™s sake. Used custom serializations for a loosely coupled system (So we can swap out the broker If wanted)
